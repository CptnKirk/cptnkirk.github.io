    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m the type of person who is constantly looking at new technology or ways of developing software.  I&rsquo;m always looking for the next big thing that will allow me to do something I couldn&rsquo;t before, or do the same stuff quicker or easier.  I&rsquo;ve recently been attracted to watching YouTube presentations on whatever it is that&rsquo;s on my mind.  Recently something got me thinking.  Nearly all of the best presentations are given by a class of developers that I associate with being &ldquo;hackers&rdquo;.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s a &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; to me?  If you&rsquo;ve ever seen the movie Hackers (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/</a>), that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m talking about.  A class of developer with a thirst for knowledge and ability.  Driven to be &ldquo;elite&rdquo; and to have their abilities recognized.  Here are a couple examples of some Erlang hackers.  The two talks are valuable in general, even if you aren&rsquo;t interested in Erlang (and if you aren&rsquo;t interested in Erlang, you probably should be :&ndash;)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGKMq0Cyiks">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGKMq0Cyiks</a> &mdash; Erlang: Noob to production in 2 months
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BNpOHFvg_Q">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BNpOHFvg_Q</a> &mdash; Lager: Logging with confidence</p>

<p>One shows how a single hacker developed and deployed a web based chat services to his community in a couple months.  The other shows how a developer decided to improve the logging standard that he was forced to work with and by doing so elevated the state of the art for an entire community.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been discussing continuous integration with my co-workers.  To most hacker cultures this is simply a given; the first presentation talks about his continuous build/deploy process.  He was pimping Erlang&rsquo;s hot code deployment and &ldquo;telnet to the VM&rdquo; capabilities, continuous integration was a given but he briefly discussed his setup.</p>

<p>So where am I going with this?  I&rsquo;ve come to realize that I respect and admire a lot of &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; qualities.  I want more of that, I want to embody more of that, and I love working with people that have similar aspirations and values.</p>

<p>Up next.  The Hacker and The Hacker Culture.</p>
